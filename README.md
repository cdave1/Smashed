# SMASHED

Smashed is a physics game I wrote for iOS.  It's a couple of years old, so I've decided to fork the original codebase into a new repository, under the GPL 3.0 License.

The game will not compile or work right out of the box just yet.  I need to clean up some of the tools so they Just Work, and this will take a couple of days.
